## Overview

A Race from the Dungeons & Dragons that is called Plasmoid! It's also a **Cuter Version** of it!

This mod uses [Skittles Advanced Template Race Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1206462931) and had referenced [Make the universe a cuter place](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761242493) in drawings.

Thislightweight race mod includes the following:

Plasmoids and Plasmoid-girls, supports variety of body color, and Plasmoid-girl has many hair disguise (such as cat girl, devil girl, fish girl and such).

- A ship of Plasmoid, which is called *Spelljammer Bombard*. Featuring open
   design, and all ship upgrades from T0 to T8.
- An animated Ship S.A.I.L. Which is a really a spirit of Spelljammer (It's in the book). Since it's an actual spirit, so I drew it.

~~The mod is based on Frankin's Universe, and has used plenty FU related content, so you need to subscribe to FU first.~~<br>
~~Meanwhile, it also has built in compatibility with FU BYOs ship, and contains race specific tech and racial traits just like other FU races.~~<br>
This is the **standalone** version, so no requirements!<br>
There is support for [Racial Traits](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622273194) though, so If you want's to spice things up a bit, there it is.

And, yeah, That's all about this mod. Nothing else lol. (really light but took me a long time to made, as an outsider using unfamiliar tools)<br>
> Planning on content expantion, aiming at somewhat similar to [Neki](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2611501999&searchtext=neki) mod. -- SGK2 [^1]

[No you DON'T. You only took 2 days, that is NOT a lot, comparing to those gigantic projects... Not that I have ever done any! :D]: #

### Q&A

- Q: Costumes and <ins>Gender</ins>?<br>
- A: You know, Plasmoid folks in D&D Does not have gender, and they reproduce by splitting themselves, or mitosis. So, the **male** Plasmoid is the **original** Plasmoid in this mod, the female Plasmoid is the **Cutefied** Plasmoid described in mod title, a slime girl.<br>
As for outfit, ~~FU got branches of nice costumes and armors and I can’t draw those kinds of nice costumes (uh... perhaps just my laziness),~~ current version of stabdalone nor FU dependent has no scheduled clothing content, so there's no costumes in this mod. Yet.

- Q: Why is it naked?<br>
- A: since the form of Plasmoid are special (mainly limbs) with new actions I animated for it, plus it doesn't have sensitive body parts, ~~so I gave it a set of FU transparent suits (the hat is in ship locker).~~ Let this race go NUDE! (what no)<br>
And... Yes, the Plasmoids in D&D are commonly naked (Really! Trust me!).
