  "description" : "[h1]Descriptions[/h1]\nA Race from the Dungeons & Dragons called [i]Plasmoid[/i]! It’s also [b]Cuter[/b] than the originals!\n\nThis lightweight race mod includes the following:\n1. Plasmoids and Plasmoid-girls, supports variety of body color, and Plasmoid-girl has many hair disguise (such as cat girl, devil girl, fish girl and such).\n2. A ship of Plasmoid, which is called [i]Spelljammer Bombard[/i]. Featuring open design, and all ship upgrades from T0 to T8.\n3. An animated Ship S.A.I.L. Which is a really a spirit of Spelljammer (It's in the book). Since it's an actual spirit, so I drew it.\n\n[strike]The mod is based on Frankin's Universe, and has used plenty FU related content, so you need to subscribe to FU first.[/strike]\nIt's now standalone! Horray!\nAnd, yeah, That's all about this race. Nothing else lol. (really light but took me a long time to made, as an outsider using unfamiliar tools)\n\n[h3]Q&A[/h3]\nQ: Costumes and [u]Genders[/u]?:\nA: You know, Plasmoid folks in D&D does not have gender, and they reproduce by splitting themselves, or mitosis. So, the male Plasmoid is the more original Plasmoid in this mod, the female Plasmoid is the 'Cutefied' Plasmoid described in mod title, a slime girl.\nAs for outfit, [strike]FU got branches of nice costumes and armors and[/strike] I can’t draw those kinds of nice costumes (uh... perhaps just my laziness), current version of stabdalone has no scheduled clothing content, so there's no costumes in this mod. [i]Yet[/i].\n\nQ: Why naked?\nA: since the form of Plasmoid are special (mainly limbs) with new actions I animated for it, plus it doesn't have sensitive body parts, so. [spoiler]Let this race go NUDE! (what no)[/spoiler] And... Yes, the Plasmoids in D&D are commonly naked. It is [url=https://spelljammer.fandom.com/wiki/Plasmoid]slime[/url], what do you expect.\n\n[h2]Links and Credits[/h2]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3128247342]Here[/url]'s the English Translation Mod. Not yet complete though.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/SGK2401/]SGK2[/url]:\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2611501999]Neki[/url] mod. It's content helped so much.\n[url=https://starbounder.org/Starbound_Wiki]Starbounder Wiki[/url].\n\nAnd of course, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/zero_xilo/]ZeroXilo[/url].
